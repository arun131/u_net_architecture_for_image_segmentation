# U-Net Architecture Implementations (Keras & PyTorch)
This repository provides implementations of the U-Net architecture for image segmentation tasks in both Keras and PyTorch.

**U-Net Architecture**:

U-Net is a convolutional neural network architecture specifically designed for image segmentation. It excels at tasks like segmenting objects or identifying specific regions within an image. The U-Net structure consists of a contracting (downsampling) path to capture features and an expanding (upsampling) path to localize those features for precise segmentation.

**Provided Files**:

u-net-architecture-keras.py: Defines and initializes a U-Net model using Keras.
u-net-architecture-pytorch.py: Defines and initializes a U-Net model using PyTorch.

**Choosing the Right Implementation**:

The choice between Keras and PyTorch depends on your preference and project requirements. Here's a brief comparison:

**Keras**:
Higher-level API, often easier to learn and use for beginners.
Leverages TensorFlow as the backend.
**PyTorch**:
More low-level and flexible, offering greater control over model building.
Provides a dynamic computational graph.
Using the Code:

**Install Dependencies**:
Ensure you have the required libraries installed using pip:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
